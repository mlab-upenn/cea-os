# cea-os
Operating System for Controlled Environment Agriculture developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's xLab group. This package can be used to manage all sensors utilized in an agriculture environment and stream data into an InfluxDB database. This data can be directly displayed onto a Grafana dashboard for viewing and analysis.\
